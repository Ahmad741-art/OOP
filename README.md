Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a programming approach that focuses on using **classes** and **objects** to model real-world entities. Key concepts include:

- **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects, defining their attributes and behaviors.
- **Objects**: Instances of classes that hold specific data and can perform actions defined by the class.
- **Encapsulation**: Restricting access to an object's data, typically making attributes private and modifying them through methods.

OOP helps in organizing code, promoting reuse, and improving readability by modeling real-world entities and relationships in your programs.
